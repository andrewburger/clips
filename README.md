CLIPS is a public domain software tool for building expert systems, probably the most widely used expert system tool. CLIPS incorporates a complete object-oriented language. CLIPS itself is written in C, extensions can be written in C, and CLIPS can be called from C. Its user interface closely resembles that of the programming language Lisp.

Another foray into a different type of programming language.
